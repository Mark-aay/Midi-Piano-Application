# Midi-Piano-Application
This application is a GUI interface of a midi piano coded in Python.
I am documenting the process of creating this application in it's various stages,
and intend to add to it often!

The first iteration of the program features a simple keyboard one octave in length. 
Upon clicking one of the keys in the application, a note is played.

I plan on adding a "reverb" button to sustain notes, and a tempo button that plays 
a metronome for the user.
